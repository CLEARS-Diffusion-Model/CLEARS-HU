# CLEARS-Battery
The Clean Energy Adoption in Residential Sector - Battery (CLEARS-Battery) is a diffusion model built to project the adoption of residential batteries. The current model is built at the regional level for Hungarian counties. The model can assess the diffusion and system impacts of residential batteries under different support schemes.

CLEARS-Battery is a diffusion model that projects the number of residential battery adopters, taking into account both financial and non-financial factors. The battery investment decision is made by agents represented by typical load profiles. Each year, the agents decide whether or not to invest in a battery. 

This version of the model has been developed for Hungary and assesses the diffusion of residential batteries in at NUTS3 level under different policy scenarios, assuming subsidy frameworks with different levels of ambition. More details can be found in the working paper titled [A Regional Residential Battery Diffusion Model](
Hartvig_Szabo_Spatial_battery_diffusion_model.pdf). The analysis can be replicated by running the [main script](CLEARS_Battery_main.py).
